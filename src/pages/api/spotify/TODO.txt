Adapting code from https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-pkce-flow
    - This example uses the Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) to
    authenticate a user. The PKCE flow is used to authenticate native and mobile applications.
    - We really just want to safely login the user without having to store their password.
    - The user will be redirected to a login page where they can enter their credentials.
    - After logging in, the user will be redirected back to the application.
    - The application will then make a request to the Spotify Accounts service to get an access
    token and a refresh token.
    - The access token is used to authorize requests to the Spotify Web API.
    - The refresh token is used to refresh the access token when it expires.

Some lines, like at the top of codechallenge are what actually get the code at runtime, and I
think we'll need to move those later.

Fix lines that use things like window

tbh you should probably scrap the requestauth file and start over
